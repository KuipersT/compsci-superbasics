Although it varies a little depending on which command shell you're using, you
can [recall previous commands]({{site.baseurl}}/command-line/previous-command)
and then edit them before pressing enter.

| Press this... | ...to do this                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">A</span> | jump to start of line |
| <span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">E</span>| jump to end of line    |
| <span class="key">←</span> and <span class="key">→</span> | run both ways along the line   |

On the Mac, in _Terminal_, if you hold down <span
class="key"><sub>alt</sub></span> you can click with the mouse on a character on
the line and the cursor will jump to that position on the line.
