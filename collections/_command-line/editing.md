Although it varies a little depending on which command shell you're using, you can recall previous commands and then edit them before pressing ENTER.

| Press this... | ...to do this                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Ctl-A         | jump to start of line          |
| Ctl-E         | jump to end of line            |
| ← and  →      | run both ways along the line   |

On the Mac, in _Terminal_, if you hold down Alt you can click with the mouse on a position on the line and the cursor will jump to that position on the line.
