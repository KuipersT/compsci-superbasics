Options usually control _how_ a command runs. Unlike arguments, they begin with a hyphen (-).

Some options just work by _being there_: these are the simplest ones to use.

Other options have a value associated with them.


A _short option_ is one letter:

    -v

A _long option_ is more than one letter, and has _two_ hyphens

    --version

Often — but not always: it depends on the command or program — the same option has both short (for convenience) and long (for clarity) forms.

The programs you write can accept options, but what they mean is up to you. Most programming languages have libraries to help you define and use your own.
