The command line shows you a prompt to indicate that it is waiting for your
input. It often also has a cursor that may be flashing or blinking.

But it's _very common_ for the prompt to be meaningful â€” and often it's the
name of directory or folder you are currently in. This is because a lot of
commands make sense depending on where you are when you issue them.

This is why often you'll see a directory name.

On your own machine, you can change your prompt to be whatever you find most
helpful. It's common for developers using git to have the _git branch name_ in
the prompt, and maybe a status indicator.
