The list of directories your command interpreter works along, looking for the program whose name you've typed, is called the _system path_, and often just "the path".

When you install a new program, the installation process will either put it in a directory that is already on the system path, or — if it makes a new directory — add the new directory to the path.

You can inspect and modify the system path on your own machine.
