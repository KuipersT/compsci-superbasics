This command works on Windows, Mac and Unix:

    pwd
    
It means "print working directory" and will show you the full name of the
directory you are in (strictly speaking, the whole "path", or address in the
[file system]({{ site.baseurl }}/file-system)).

So type `pwd` and hit enter.

The computer looks at your command and sees if it knows a command with that
name. It does, so it executes it: it prints out its answer, and then it's
finished. Because it's got nothing more to do, it throws up a new prompt for
you.
