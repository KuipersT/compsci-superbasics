* Why are the SHIFT buttons called "shift"?
* Why is the space button so much bigger? Do _you_ press it with your thumb?
* All your keys are debounced on the electrical level...
* ...but actually you _could_ debounce your buttons on (say) your webforms (no human can _mean_ to press "pay" within 500ms of the last time, right? Are you checking for that?)
* Why do the keys have CAPITAL letters on them when most of the time you're getting lower case?
* Are number pad buttons different from keyboard numbers?
* What's a keylogger?
* What's a Dvorak keyboard?
* In Javascript in your browser... can you detect when the left and right SHIFT keys are pressed â€” and tell which is which?
