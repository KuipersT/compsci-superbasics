Some keyboards have a number pad: that's a block of number keys arranged in a
grid. If you're typing a lot of numbers, using these is much more convenient
than the row of number keys above the letters.

Because the number pad keys are arranged in a grid, it's also a useful layout
for the [arrow keys]({{ site.baseurl }}/keyboard/arrow-keys).

The number lock key lets you switch the number pad's keys' behaviour between
those two modes. Press it to toggle between numbers (num lock _on_) or arrows
(num lock _off_).
