These are _generally_ used in computing — but you should understand that when you press a key, what you are really doing is sending a signal to the program that is listening ("has the focus"), and it's up to that program how it should respond to it.

| key   | what it does |
|-------|--------------|
| Ctl-Z |   exit       |
| Ctl-C |   copy       |
| Ctl-X |   cut        |
| Ctl-V |   paste      |
| Ctl-S |   save       |
| Ctl-F |   find       |
| Ctl-D |   terminate input  |

On the Mac, these are Command (⌘), not control (remember: they are different keys!).
