<span class="key"><sub>ctrl</sub></span><span class="key">C</span>

The convention for cancelling or interrupting a process is to press Ctrl-C
(that is: hold down the control key and press C). This sends an *interrupt
signal*.

It's up to the program that's listening to your keystrokes to decide how to
respond.
