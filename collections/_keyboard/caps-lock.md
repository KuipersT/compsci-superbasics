The Caps Lock key is usually used to _lock_ the input to CAPITAL (or upper case) letters. Press it again to _unlock_. This button is unusual because it's used to _toggle_ between states. If you press it, the capitals are locked on. If you press it again, the lock is taken off. 

Later you might find this causes you more trouble than it's worth, and you 
accidentally put caps lock on AND START SHOUTING BY MISTAKE. For this reason it's common for some developers to disable the CAPS LOCK key.
