Some keys are _modifier_ keys: they change the meaning of the other key you press. A clear example of this is A (gives a) and SHIFT-A (gives A): SHIFT here is a modifier.

To start with you just use these to type... but in computing, the modifier keys are really used to provide far more key combinations than there are buttons on your keyboard.

The meanings of keys can be mapped to _anything_, but these are the
conventional uses:

| key      | Symbol  | example of what might do               |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SHIFT    |         | shift to upper case                        |
| Alternate | Alt <br>⌥ <br> Option  | generate alternate character (e.g., £ or #)    |
| Control  | ^ <br> Ctl <br> Ctrl | turn other key(s) into a control signal   |
| Function | Fn      | turn the other key(s) into a function button    |
| Command  | ⌘       | (on Mac) execute shortcut (the other keys(s)) |
| Windows  | Win  <br> ⊞  | (on Windows — pressing Ctl+Escape does the same) launch start menu   |

If you see Ctl-SHIFT-C, that means "hold down the control key and the shift key and then press C". Those first two are modifying the C.  What that _actually_ does will depend on the program that is listening to it.
