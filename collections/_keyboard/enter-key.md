The ENTER key is often special because it's used to indicate the _submitting input_.
You might already be used to using it to mean "go" or "send". See the introduction to command line for more.

In word processors or text editors the ENTER key indicates a new line — this is really from the days of "carriage-return and newline" from typewriters. This legacy still exists in _line-endings_ (which are different between Windows and Unix).

The Enter key is often used to _confirm_  a program or process — often it will close a dialogue box just as if you had clicked OK.
