Also known as: "the directory above".

The parent of _any directory_ has the
[special name]({{ site.baseurl}}/files/special-names) `..` (two dots).

This is useful because you can include it in file paths. Furthermore, this
applies to the context of the path â€” that means `../..` is the
parent-of-the-parent.

The path to the file `notes.txt` in the parent directory is:

    ../notes.txt

The path the file `average.py` three directories _above_ your
current directory is:

    ../../../average.py
