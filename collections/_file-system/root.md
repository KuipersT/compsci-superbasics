The topmost directory — the only one that is not inside another directory —
is called the root, or (more commonly) just "root".

On Unix systems, the name of the root directory is `/`.

On Windows, use `\` instead of `/`.

Because root is at the top, every file in the file system is below root.

> Note: "root" is also the username of the top administrator or superuser

> This is because they are both the root of their tree hierarchies: all

> below the root user.
