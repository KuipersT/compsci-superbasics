The topmost directory — the only one that is not inside another directory —
is called the root, or (more commonly) just "root".

Because root is at the top, every file in the file system is below root.

> Note: "root" is also the username of the administrator or "superuser"
> account on Unix systems. That's not the same as the root directory.
